##MENSAGEM PERDIDA##
03 - By now you should've somehow
04 - Realized what you gotta do
05 - I don't believe that anybody
06 - Feels the way I do, about you now
07 - Backbeat, the word was on the street
08 - That the fire in your heart is out
09 - I'm sure you've heard it all before
10 - But you never really had a doubt
11 - I don't believe that anybody
12 - Feels the way I do about you now
13 - And all the roads we have to walk are winding
14 - And all the lights that lead us there are blinding
15 - There are many things that I
16 - Would like to say to you but I don't know how
17 - Because maybe, you're gonna be the one that saves me
18 - And after all, you're my wonderwall
19 - Today was gonna be the day
20 - But they'll never throw it back to you

23 - I don't believe that anybody
24 - Feels the way I do, about you now
25 - And all the roads that lead you there are winding
26 - And all the lights that light the way are blinding
27 - There are many things that I
28 - Would like to say to you but I don't know how
29 - I said maybe, you're gonna be the one that saves me
30 - And after all, you're my wonderwall
31 - I said maybe, you're gonna be the one that saves me
32 - And after all, you're my wonderwall
33 - I said maybe, you're gonna be the one that saves me
34 - you're gonna be the one that saves me
35 - you're gonna be the one that saves me
